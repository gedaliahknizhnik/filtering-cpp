A header-only CPP smoothing library for incoming data streams. Currently the following filters are supported:
1. Exponential filter
2. Moving average filter.

Future plans involve conan-izing this library for installation and inclusion, but for the time being simply include `filter.hpp`.

Future plans also include adding multiple data streams.
